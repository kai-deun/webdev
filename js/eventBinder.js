/*
This class will compile all of the functions that will get 
binded to the events (e.g. click, keypress, etc.). This is done for readability and modularity.

NOTE:
This class is mostly used to button functions because the onclick="" (event handler) attribute is not working properly
There are also some contents such as the search, filter and switch tab that are included here.

//TODO: functions needed to be binded to events (button, search, dropdown, etc.).
